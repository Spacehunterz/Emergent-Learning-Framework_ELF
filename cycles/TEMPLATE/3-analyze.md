**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Experiment:** [Name]

## Failure Analysis
[Deep examination of why things broke]

### Root Causes
1. [Primary cause of failure]
   - Evidence: [What supports this conclusion]
   - Impact: [How significant this was]

2. [Secondary cause of failure]
   - Evidence: [What supports this conclusion]
   - Impact: [How significant this was]

### Contributing Factors

## Surprising Findings
[Things that contradicted assumptions or expectations]

1. [Unexpected finding]
   - **Expected:** [What we thought would happen]
   - **Actual:** [What actually happened]
   - **Implication:** [What this means]

2. [Another unexpected finding]
   - **Expected:** [What we thought would happen]
   - **Actual:** [What actually happened]
