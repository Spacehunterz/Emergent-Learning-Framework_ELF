- [Aspect to maintain]
- [Another aspect to maintain]

### Minor Adjustments
- [Small tweak to apply]
- [Another minor adjustment]

### Success Metrics for Next Cycle
- [Metric 1]
- [Metric 2]

## If MODIFY
[Skip this section if not modifying]

### What Changes

   - **Reason:** [Why this change]
   - **Expected Impact:** [What we expect this will do]

2. [Another major change]
   - **Reason:** [Why this change]
   - **Expected Impact:** [What we expect this will do]

### What Remains
- [Core aspect preserved]
- [Another preserved aspect]

### New Success Metrics
- [Updated metric 1]
- [Updated metric 2]

## If PIVOT
[Skip this section if not pivoting]

- [Another element to preserve]

### What Gets Abandoned
- [Aspect being left behind]
- [Another abandoned aspect]

### Justification
[Why such a significant change is warranted]

## If ESCALATE
[Skip this section if not escalating]

### Issue Requiring Escalation

## If TERMINATE
[Skip this section if not terminating]

### Termination Reason
- [ ] Hypothesis Confirmed - Experiment successful
- [ ] Hypothesis Rejected - Experiment failed conclusively
- [ ] Approach Unworkable - Cannot proceed with this method
