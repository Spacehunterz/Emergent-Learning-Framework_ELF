# Phase 2: BREAK

**Cycle:** [Number]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Experiment:** [Name]

## Stress Tests Applied
[Description of how we attempted to break or stress the implementation]

### Test 1: [Name]
- **Method:** [How we applied stress]
- **Intensity:** [Low | Medium | High | Extreme]
- **Duration:** [How long]
- **Result:** [What happened]

### Test 2: [Name]
- **Method:** [How we applied stress]
- **Intensity:** [Low | Medium | High | Extreme]
- **Duration:** [How long]
- **Result:** [What happened]

## What Broke
[List of failures, errors, unexpected behaviors under stress]

### Critical Failures
- [Failure that invalidated the approach]
- [Another critical failure]

### Minor Failures
- [Degradation or sub-optimal behavior]
- [Another minor failure]

## What Survived
[What remained functional or effective despite stress]

### Robust Elements
- [Component or approach that held up]
- [Another robust element]

### Graceful Degradations
- [How the system failed safely or partially]

## Breaking Points Identified
[Specific limits, thresholds, or boundaries discovered]

## Notes
[Additional observations during stress testing]
