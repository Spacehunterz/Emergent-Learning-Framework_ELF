[2025-12-07 17:18:12] [INFO] [record-heuristic] Recording heuristic: Lazy Wrap Principle: Cursor wrap should be deferred (phantom cursor at index width) until a printable character needs placement, not triggered eagerly on reaching the boundary. Control codes like CR should execute BEFORE any pending wrap. (domain: terminal-emulation, confidence: 0.95)
