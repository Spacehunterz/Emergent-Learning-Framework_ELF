HOW TO USE PHASE 1
==================

For New Developers:
  1. Read: DX_README.md
  2. Try: make help
  3. Use: make setup
  4. Ask: See docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md first

For Maintainers:
  1. Read: DX_EVALUATION_REPORT.md
  2. Plan: DX_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
  3. Implement: Phases 2-4 (20 hours over 3 weeks)

NEXT STEPS (PHASES 2-4)
======================
