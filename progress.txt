# Ralph Loop Progress Tracking

This file is append-only. Each iteration adds its learnings here.
It serves as the institutional memory bridging fresh Claude Code sessions.

## How to Use

Each session should append an entry like:

```
## [ISO Date] - [Story ID]: [Brief Title]
- Learning 1
- Learning 2
- Issue encountered and resolution
```

---

## Session History

(Entries appear here as each iteration completes)

### 2026-01-15 - Ralph Loop Restructuring Initiated
- Discovered previous implementation was wrong: simulated agents instead of real sessions
- Real Ralph pattern: bash loop spawns fresh session per story
- Key insight: PRD.json holds state, progress.txt holds learnings, each session is stateless
- Need to rewrite ralph_orchestrator.py as ralph.sh
- jq is critical for parsing prd.json - must be available

---

## Patterns Learned

### Context Management
- Each fresh session has clean context
- Only cross-session memory: git history + prd.json + this file
- Do not rely on in-memory state between iterations

### Story Completion
- One story per iteration keeps scope tight
- Acceptance criteria must be testable
- Commit message should reference story ID

### Progress Tracking
- Use [LEARNED:domain] markers in session work
- Append final summary to this file before exiting
- Focus on transferable lessons, not just outcomes
