# Ralph Loop Progress Tracking

This file is append-only. Each iteration adds its learnings here.
It serves as the institutional memory bridging fresh Claude Code sessions.

## How to Use

Each session should append an entry like:

```
## [ISO Date] - [Story ID]: [Brief Title]
- Learning 1
- Learning 2
- Issue encountered and resolution
```

---

## Session History

(Entries appear here as each iteration completes)

### 2026-01-15 - Ralph Loop Restructuring Completed
- LEARNED:workflow: Ralph Loop must spawn FRESH sessions per story, not orchestrate locally
- LEARNED:architecture: Three-file blackboard pattern: prd.json (state) + progress.txt (memory) + prompt.md (work order)
- LEARNED:workflow: Previous implementation was fundamentally wrong - had simulated agents instead of real sessions
- LEARNED:performance: Context degradation solved by: one story per iteration + fresh session + prd.json as memory
- LEARNED:bash: Use Python for JSON parsing in bash scripts when jq unavailable (Windows compatibility)
- Fixed pre-commit hook to call ralph.sh instead of old orchestrator
- Tested: ralph.sh correctly identifies stories, generates prompts, updates status
- Key design: Each iteration is stateless except for git history + prd.json + progress.txt

### 2026-01-15 - Ralph Loop Ready for Real Execution
- ralph.sh fully functional: bash orchestrator, PRD parsing, story selection working
- init-ralph.sh bootstrap script created and tested
- Documentation complete (ralph-loop-guide.md)
- NOTE: ralph.sh is meant to spawn NEW sessions, not run within current session
- claude-code CLI needs to be installed for ralph.sh to spawn iterations
- In normal operation: user runs `bash ralph.sh` → spawns fresh claude-code per story
- Each spawned session reads prompt.md, implements story, updates progress.txt, exits
- This is a FEATURE: fresh context per iteration prevents degradation

## Patterns Learned

### Context Management
- Each fresh session has clean context
- Only cross-session memory: git history + prd.json + this file
- Do not rely on in-memory state between iterations

### Story Completion
- One story per iteration keeps scope tight
- Acceptance criteria must be testable
- Commit message should reference story ID

### Progress Tracking
- Use [LEARNED:domain] markers in session work
- Append final summary to this file before exiting
- Focus on transferable lessons, not just outcomes
