## Test Categories

### 1. NULL Byte Injection
Tests whether NULL bytes (\x00) can corrupt database storage or markdown files.

**Risk**: NULL bytes can truncate strings in C-based libraries, causing data loss or injection.

### 2. Very Long Unicode
Tests handling of extremely long Unicode sequences (500+ emoji).

**Risk**: Memory exhaustion, buffer overflows, or rendering issues.

### 3. RTL Text Mixing
Tests bidirectional text (Hebrew/Arabic) mixed with English and RTL override characters.

**Risk**: UI spoofing, display corruption, or text direction attacks.

### 4. Zalgo Text
Tests combining diacritical marks stacked on characters.

**Risk**: Rendering issues, excessive memory use, or display corruption.

### 5. Non-BMP Characters
Tests Unicode characters outside Basic Multilingual Plane (mathematical symbols, ancient scripts).

**Risk**: Encoding errors in systems assuming 16-bit Unicode.

### 6. CRLF Injection
Tests carriage return/line feed injection to insert new markdown headers.

**Risk**: Markdown structure injection, metadata spoofing.

### 7. Control Characters
Tests bell, backspace, ANSI escape sequences, and terminal control codes.

**Risk**: Terminal manipulation, visual spoofing, or logging corruption.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### NO CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FOUND

All edge cases were handled correctly. The system either:
- Safely rejected invalid input (fail-safe behavior)
- Properly sanitized and stored the data
- Correctly handled Unicode edge cases

The current implementation shows robust input validation.

## Recommendations

1. **Input Validation**: Continue validating all user input
2. **Encoding**: Maintain UTF-8 throughout the pipeline
3. **Sanitization**: Escape/remove control characters before storage
4. **Testing**: Add these edge cases to automated test suite
5. **Monitoring**: Log rejected inputs for security analysis

## Technical Details

- **Database**: SQLite with UTF-8 encoding
- **Escape Function**: Single quote doubling for SQL injection prevention
- **Markdown**: Direct variable interpolation (potential injection point)
- **File Operations**: TOCTOU and hardlink protection in place
