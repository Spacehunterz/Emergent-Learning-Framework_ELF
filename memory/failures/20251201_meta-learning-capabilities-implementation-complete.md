## Summary

Opus Agent J successfully implemented comprehensive meta-learning capabilities:
- Self-diagnostics (self-test.sh) - can detect own bugs and auto-record failures
- Learning velocity metrics (learning-metrics.sh) - tracks learnings/day, promotion rates, acceleration
- Circular dependency checker (dependency-check.sh) - validates system can monitor itself safely
- Bootstrap recovery (bootstrap-recovery.sh) - recovers from corruption, rebuilds from markdown
- Deduplication system (deduplicate-failures.sh) - identifies duplicate/similar failures
- Heuristic auto-suggestion (suggest-heuristics.sh) - extracts patterns and suggests heuristics

System can now learn about itself. All scripts tested and operational. ~2500 lines of code. Full report in META_LEARNING_REPORT.md
