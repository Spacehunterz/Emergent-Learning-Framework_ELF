# BYOK Philosophy

**Created:** 2024-12-04
**Confidence:** 0.7
**Domain:** claudex, business-model, product-strategy

## Heuristic

Don't be the middleman extracting margin on AI/music/chat services. Be the beautiful interface that integrates the user's own services.

## Details

Let users bring their own:
- API keys (Claude, OpenAI, etc.)
- Spotify/YouTube accounts
- Slack/Discord logins

Monetize the **experience** (themes, avatars, marketplace) not the **access**.

## Why This Works

- Users already pay for these services
- Adding a markup feels greedy and creates resentment
- BYOK builds trust and user alignment
- Marketplace revenue is sustainable without being extractive
- Differentiates from VC-funded competitors (Warp charges $50/month for AI)

## Counter-example

Warp charges $50/month for AI with 1500 request limits. They're the middleman. Users feel nickel-and-dimed.
