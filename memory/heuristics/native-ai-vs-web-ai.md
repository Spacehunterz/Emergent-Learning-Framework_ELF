# Native AI vs Web AI

**Created:** 2024-12-04
**Confidence:** 0.8
**Domain:** claudex, ai-integration, product-strategy

## Heuristic

Native desktop AI can actually *do things* on the user's system. Web AI is just a consultant you email back and forth. Build for native.

## Details

### Web AI Limitations (sandboxed in browser)
- Cannot see local files
- Cannot run shell commands
- Cannot check if fixes worked
- User is the manual middleware (copy/paste/copy/paste)

### Native AI Capabilities
- Reads actual codebase
- Runs real shell commands
- Sees terminal output in real-time
- Iterates until the problem is solved

## The Analogy

| Type | What It's Like |
|------|----------------|
| Web AI | A consultant you email back and forth |
| Native AI | A coworker sitting at your desk |

## Why This Matters

Most people don't understand this distinction yet. They use ChatGPT/Claude web for coding help and don't realize they're doing it the hard way.

Native AI integration is the paradigm shift. Claudex is positioned to capitalize on this before it becomes obvious to everyone.
