## Heuristic

Don't build "a better terminal" - build "the developer's cockpit." The unique value isn't in any single feature, it's in the integrated experience.

## Details

Started with: "Semantic terminal that understands command output"
Pivoted to: "Developer cockpit - terminal, AI, music, chat, all in one window"

### The Problem with "Better Terminal"
- Commodity market
- Warp has $73M and 50+ people
- Hard to differentiate on terminal features alone

### The Opportunity with "Developer Cockpit"
- Solves alt-tab hell
- Integrates everything developers use daily
- Marketplace creates ecosystem and revenue
- Personality (avatars, themes) differentiates from boring tools

## Components of the Cockpit
1. Terminal (foundation)
2. Web view with hot reload (preview)
3. AI assistant with personality (BYOK)
4. Music integration (Spotify/YouTube)
5. Chat integration (Slack/Discord)
6. Marketplace (themes, avatars, sounds)

## Why This Works

Developers spend 8+ hours in these tools. They want:
- Less context switching
- More personality/fun
- Tools that feel aligned with them, not extracting from them
