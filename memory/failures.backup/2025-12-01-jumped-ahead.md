# Failure: Jumped Ahead Without Asking

**Date:** 2025-12-01
**Domain:** process, communication
**Severity:** Medium

## What Happened
User mentioned NVIDIA Audio2Face-3D and had ideas about 3D meshes. Instead of asking about their vision, I immediately started exploring alternative 2D solutions (wav2lip) that I thought were "better."

## The Mistake
- Assumed I knew the better path
- Didn't ask "what are you thinking?" first
- Changed direction without permission

## Lesson
**Always ask before pivoting.** User may have a specific vision or learning goal. My job is to help them explore THEIR ideas, not redirect to what I think is optimal.

## Heuristic
When user proposes approach A and I see approach B:
1. FIRST: "Tell me more about your idea"
2. THEN: If asked, share alternatives
3. NEVER: Just pivot without asking
