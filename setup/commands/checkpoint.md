Update project.md with all recent changes, decisions, and current status.

**Instructions:**
1. Read the current project.md file
2. Update the following sections:
   - **Last Updated**: Set to current timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
   - **Current Status**: Update "Current Focus" with what we're working on now
   - **Change Log**: Add entries for all changes since last checkpoint using format:
     `**YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM** - [What changed] - [File:line] - [Why]`
   - **Active Issues**: Update or remove resolved issues, add new ones
   - **Key Decisions**: Add any architectural or important decisions made
   - **Next Steps**: Update the task list

3. Only include code/app-related changes - no conversations or simple questions

4. Keep entries concise but complete

5. After updating, confirm: "✅ Checkpoint saved to project.md"

6. Reset the checkpoint counter by running: `echo '0' > .claude/.checkpoint_counter`

If project.md doesn't exist, inform the user that project memory tracking is not initialized for this directory.
